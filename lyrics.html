    <h1 id="1"> The Doors-Don't you love her madly</h1>
    <pre>[Intro]
        Don't ya love her madly?
        Don't ya need her badly?
        Don't ya love her ways?
        Tell me what you say
        
        [Verse]
        Don't you love her madly?
        Wanna be her daddy?
        Don't ya love her face?
        Don't ya love her as she's walkin' out the door
        Like she did one thousand times before?
        
        [Bridge]
        Don't you love her ways?
        Tell me what you say
        Don't ya love her as she's walking out the door?
        
        [Chorus 1]
        All your love
        All your love
        All your love
        All your love
        
        [Chorus 2]
        All your love is gone
        So sing a lonely song
        Of a deep blue dream
        Seven horses seem to be on the mark

    <pre>[Verse 1]
        I am a passenger
        And I ride and I ride
        I ride through the city's backsides
        I see the stars come out of the sky
        Yeah, they're bright in a hollow sky
        You know it looks so good tonight
        
        [Verse 2]
        I am the passenger
        I stay under glass
        I look through my window so bright
        I see the stars come out tonight
        I see the bright and hollow sky
        Over the city's ripping sky
        And everything looks good tonight
        
        [Chorus]
        Singin' la la la la la la la la
        La la la la la la la la
        La la la la la la la la la la</pre>

    <h1 id="3"> Pink Floyd-Wish you were here</h1>
    <pre>
        [Verse 1: Don Henley]
On a dark desert highway
Cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas
Rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance
I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night
There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself
"This could be Heaven or this could be Hell"
Then she lit up a candle
And she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say

        [Verse 1]
I am a passenger
And I ride and I ride
I ride through the city's backsides
I see the stars come out of the sky
Yeah, they're bright in a hollow sky
You know it looks so good tonight

[Verse 2]
I am the passenger
I stay under glass
I look through my window so bright
I see the stars come out tonight
I see the bright and hollow sky
Over the city's ripping sky
And everything looks good tonight

[Chorus]
Singin' la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la
